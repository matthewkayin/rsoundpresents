                <h1 class="host-header">Kenon Brinkley</h1>
                <p class="host-desc">Kenon “KJ” Brinkley doesn’t know what he wants in his bio. Hell, he rarely knows what he’s
                    doing on the mic, but he’s happy to dabble in anything from hosting, to singing, to rapping, to poetry, the
                    tenor sax, or whatever he can get his hands on. A Rick to many, with a heart pickled to peculiarity by music,
                    art, and anime, KJ would rather you just come see the show to learn a bit of what he’s all about.</p>

                <p class="host-desc">Xan Mattek is a sophomore at Wichita State University studying musical theatre. She is originally
                    from Salina, where though it is a small town, she has always been able to find pockets of artistic communities to
                    thrive in. When she arrived in Wichita R Sound was one of the first creative spaces to invite her in and she is so
                    glad that she's been granted the opportunity to invite others as well per her supportive cohosts Kenon and Kelsey.</p>
