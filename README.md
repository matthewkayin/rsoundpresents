# R Sound Presents
Repo for the website for R Sound Presents, a monthly music and poetry show in Wichita. I used github pages to host the site (using namecheap to mirror the domain).
You can still checkout the up-to-date site at https://matthewkayin.github.io/rsoundpresents/. A lot of my education in HTML / CSS is very minimal and need-based.
I haven't done a lot to learn web development for the sake of learning. However with this attempt at the site I learned a lot about how to build good static sites, with the biggest takeaway being that to make your site truly responsive it's easiest to develop mobile first.
Taking a mobile site and adding CSS rules to make it work for desktop is far easier than doing things the other way around, and the results are usually better that way.
